====================

An experiment to implement a height map generator in Rust.

In another project, https://github.com/gilles-leblanc/gameproject, a game project in progress, programmed in Ruby, I am using a height map generator. Said generator uses a particle deposition algorithm (http://gillesleblanc.wordpress.com/2012/08/22/generating-heightmaps-using-particle-deposition/). The maps are then converted to a 2d world map (http://gillesleblanc.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/creating-a-random-2d-game-world-map/).

This is an experiment to implement a very similar program with initially a similar algorithm (could later be expended to use more efficient and perfomant algorithms) but in Rust.
